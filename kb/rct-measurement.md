# RCT Measurements

Validity & Reliability:
- Reliable == Precision
- Valid == Accurate

Validity - types:
- Face validity (expert opinion)
- Construct validity (convergence)
- Content // (completeness)
- Criterion validity (gold standard)
    - Measurements that match up (concordance) with a gold standard measurement
Precedence from previous studies is important, but not enough (especially if you use the measurement differently)

Reliability:
- Does the measure give you the answer each time
- Systematic: consistent repeatable error
- Random error: random all over error
    - an argument against stopping trials early. Large benefit may be due to random error with few samples.

## Outcomes
What should be priority?
- Showing effect of intervention. e.g: molecular effect.
- Importance to patients/practioners. e.g: Life extended.

We should try to priortize patient important outcomes. But
- May be more difficult to show significance for an intervention
- Treatment effects may be small, so require very large patient samples for the study.

Possible alternatives to reduce required sample size:
- Use a surrogate measurement. fewer samples, but may not capture important outcome.
- Use a composite endpoints (CEPs): multiple end points are an event.
    - capture the number of patients experiencing one or more event types
    - commonly used in cardiology to reduce required sample size (by increasing event rate and statistical power).

Problems with CEPs:
- Competing risks:
    - avoid scenario of solution that kills high risk patients but improves overall (like high risk surgery reducing stroke)
- Combining critical and non-critical endpoints in a CEP. It can dilute or inflate your effect on important patient outcomes.
    - effect may be non-uniform over the composite endpoints
    - We should look at composite effect and on individual outcomes (or classes of outcomes by importance).
    - Researchers may be p-hacking through selecting their composites.
    - But this could work the other way (significant effects on important endopoints masked by no effect on less important endpoints).

## What do I measure?
What should we measure at different stages of trial:
- Screening
- Randomization (Stratification variables)
- Baseline
    - Subroup analysis may show effect within a subset. But careful of non pre-specified subgroups or too many/small subgroups.
- Follow-up:
    - consider priority of outcomes, prioritize important ones.
    - Adherence
    - How it's measured? Determine the who, what instrument (validity, reliability), when, how often, cost, independent expert adjudication.
- Close

Picking the outcome measure:
- Quality of life measure
    - Generic questionnaire and disease specific
        - could be redudndant and add to patient burden.
- Consider effect of outcome measure on patient rollout and dropout.
- Consider difficulty of making measurement, budget, etc.
