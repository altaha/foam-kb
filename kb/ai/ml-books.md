# Important ML/Stats Books

### [Introduction to Statistical Learning - 2013](statlearning.com) (Hastie, Tibshirani, et al)
- Introduction to Statistical Learning - a more accessible version of the Elements of Statistical learning book.
- Associated code is in R
- Associated MOOC video series by authors: https://www.dataschool.io/15-hours-of-expert-machine-learning-videos/ and [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOg0ngHtcqbPTlZzRHA2ocQZqB1D_qZ5V)

### [Elements of Statistical Learning - 2nd ed - 2008](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf) (Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman)
- A more advanced and comprehensive version of the above

### [Computer Age Statistical Inference - 2016](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI_files/PDF/casi.pdf) (Efron, Hastie)
- Looks very interesing. Covers a wide range of statistical inference topics (classical, Bayesian, MCMC) as well as a number of the most re;evant modern ML algorithms

### [Deep Learning - 2016](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) (Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville)
- A modern classic. Has a good math intro, and dives into details of Deep Learning models (basics, CNNs, RNNs, some research topics).
- From 2016 so missing important new advances such as Attention, Transformers, etc

### NLP and Speech Processing: [Speech & Language Processing - 3rd ed - 2021](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) (Jurafsky, Martin)
- Comprehensive text on NLP. Was used as reference for COMP550 course. Still in development. Includes chapters on modern topics such as Transformers.

### Probability and Statistics Book
- Introudctory text. It was used for the two McGill courses on Probability and Statistics
- I have the PDF and the solution manual

## Other ML books:
- [Dive into Deep Learning - D2L](https://d2l.ai/)
    - More of a practical book. But covers alot of topics.
    - An issue is that code is based on MXNet because authors are from Amazon (some community adaptations to TF & PyTorch)
- Probabilistic Machine Learning - book series by Kevin Murphy:
    - [Book 0: Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective (2012)](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book0.html)
    - [Book 1: Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction (2021)](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/)
    - [Book 2: Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics (2022)](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/)
    - Looks quite good. Includes sections on topics such as optimization. Book 1 & 2 still being written. It appears that book 0 is the original. Book 1 is a reboot and update, and due to large content the author decided to spread over two books (1 and 2). Book was referencd by Will Hamilton when he was mentioning that most ML models can be derived from a probabilistic perspective.
- [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf) (Bishop)
    - A classic from 2006, so quite old. I remember it being dense when I tried reading it years ago. But I was also a total noob.
